# Creating dedicated IP pools<a name="channels-email-dedicated-ips-pools"></a>

If you purchased several dedicated IP addresses to use with Amazon Pinpoint, you can create groups of those addresses\. These groups are called *dedicated IP pools*\. A common scenario is to create one pool of dedicated IP addresses for sending marketing communications, and another for sending transactional emails\. Your sender reputation for transactional emails is then isolated from that of your marketing emails\. In this scenario, if a marketing campaign generates a large number of complaints, the delivery of your transactional emails isn't impacted\. 

Dedicated IP pools are available for use in both Amazon Pinpoint and Amazon Simple Email Service \(Amazon SES\)\. When you create a dedicated IP pool, you have to choose a configuration set to associate it with\. Currently, you can only manage configuration sets and IP pools using Amazon SES\. For more information about setting up configuration sets, see [Creating configuration sets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-configuration-sets.html) in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\. For more information about setting up dedicated IP pools, see [Creating dedicated IP pools]() in the *Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide*\.

In order to use configuration sets \(and therefore, dedicated IP pools\) with Amazon Pinpoint, you must configure the configuration set as the default configuration set for the email identities that you use with Amazon Pinpoint\.
