When you register your company, you see one of two registration statuses: **Verified** or **Unverified**\. If the company registration status is **Verified**, then your company registration was successful\. You can begin to create 10DLC campaigns\.

If the status for your company registration is **Unverified**, there were issues with the information that you provided\. The Amazon Pinpoint console provides information about the reasons that your company registration received this status\.
