# Getting started with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="gettingstarted"></a>

To start sending targeted messages in Amazon Pinpoint, you have to complete a few steps\. For example, you have to add customer contact information into Amazon Pinpoint, and then create segments that target certain customers\. Next, you have to create your messages and schedule your campaigns\. Finally, after you send your campaigns, you can use the analytics dashboards that are built into Amazon Pinpoint to see how well the campaigns performed\.

This tutorial includes procedures for all steps involved in sending an email campaign to a segment of customers with the Amazon Pinpoint console\.

**Note**  
As soon as you set up a new Amazon Pinpoint account, it is placed in a sandbox for email, SMS, and voice message channels until you request production access\. In the sandbox, you can access all of Amazon Pinpoint's features, with the following restrictions on your email, SMS, and voice messages:  
For email sandbox restrictions, see [Amazon Pinpoint email sandbox](channels-email-setup-production-access.md)\. 
For SMS sandbox restrictions, see [Amazon Pinpoint SMS sandbox](channels-sms-sandbox.md)\. 
For voice sandbox restrictions, see [Amazon Pinpoint voice sandbox](channels-voice-sandbox.md)\. 
There are no Amazon Pinpoint sandbox restrictions for push notifications\. 
To move to production access from the sandbox, create an AWS Support case for a **Service limit increase** request for each channel you want to move\.
