# Requesting support for SMS messaging with Amazon Pinpoint<a name="channels-sms-awssupport"></a>

Certain SMS options in Amazon Pinpoint can only be configured by creating a case in the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/)\. Open a case to request any of the following:
+ 

**An increase to your monthly SMS spending threshold**  
By default, the monthly spending threshold is $1\.00 \(USD\)\. Your spending threshold determines the volume of messages that you can send with Amazon Pinpoint\. Request a spending threshold that meets the expected monthly message volume for your SMS use case\.
+ 

**A dedicated short code**  
*Short codes* are short phone numbers \(typically 5â€“6 digits\) that are used to send SMS messages\. Short code availability and capabilities vary by country or region\. Typically, short codes offer higher throughput than other types of dedicated phone numbers\. Short codes also support two\-way messaging\. However, they usually cost more than other number types, and can take a long time to obtain\.
+ 

**A dedicated sender ID**  
A *sender ID* is an alphabetic identifier that's shown as the sender on the recipient's device\. For example, you can use your business name to make the message source easier to recognize\. Support for sender IDs varies by country or region\. For more information, see [Supported countries and regions \(SMS channel\)](channels-sms-countries.md)\.
+ 

**A long code that you can't purchase through the Amazon Pinpoint console**  
You can purchase long codes for several countries directly through the Amazon Pinpoint console\. Long codes are available in several additional countries\. Pricing and availability of long codes varies by country\.
+ 

**Changes to a 10DLC company registration**  
You can [edit most parts of your 10DLC company registration](settings-sms-10dlc-modify-company.md) through the Amazon Pinpoint console\. However, the **Tax ID** and **Registered Company Name** fields can only be modified by opening an AWS Support ticket\.

When you create your case in the AWS Support Center, include all the information that's required for the type of request you're submitting\. If you don't, AWS Support will contact you to obtain this information before proceeding\. By submitting a detailed case, you help ensure that your request is fulfilled quickly\. For the details that are required for specific types of SMS requests, see the topics in this section\.
