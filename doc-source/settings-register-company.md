# Registering a company<a name="settings-register-company"></a>

Before you can request a 10DLC, you must register your company with The Campaign Registry\. 

You only need to register your company once\. After it's registered, you can edit most of your company and contact information\. To delete a registered company, create a case with AWS Support\. For more information about editing or deleting company details, see [Editing or deleting a registered company](settings-company-10dlc-edit-delete.md)\. 

**To register a company**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Pinpoint console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/pinpoint/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/)\.

1. Under **Account Settings**, **SMS and voice**, choose **10DLC campaigns**\.

1. Choose **Register company**\. 

1. On the **Register your company** page, view the **Registration fee**\. This is a one\-time fee associated with registering your company\. This cost is separate from any other monthly costs or fees\. It is charged to you only when your company has been registered\.

1. In the **Company info** section, provide the following information:
   + **Legal company name** – This is the name under which the company is registered\. You must use the company's legal name\. 
**Important**  
Make sure to use your company's exact legal name\. Once submitted you can't change this information\. Incorrect or incomplete information might result in your registration being delayed or denied\.
   + **What type of legal form is this organization** – Choose one of the following from the dropdown list: **Private profit**, **Public for profit**, or **Not for profit**\.
   + If you choose **Public for profit**, you're prompted to supply the company's stock symbol and the stock exchange on which it's listed\.
   + Choose the country where the company is registered from the **Country of registration** list\.
   + If the company is known by any name other than its registered name, enter that name in the **Doing Business As \(DBA\) or brand name** field\. 
   + Enter the business's **Tax ID**\. In the United States, this is a 9\-digit number\. A tax ID is required, so you must provide an actual tax ID\. Do not leave this blank or complete with false information\. Once submitted you can't change this information\.
   + For **Vertical**, choose the vertical market that most closely resembles the company you're registering\.

1. In the **Contact info** section, provide contact information for contacting the company\.
   + **Address/Street** – The physical street address\. 
   + **City** – The city in which the physical address is located\.
   + **State or region** – The state or region where the address is located\.
   + **Zip Code /Postal Code** – The associated ZIP or postal code for the address\.
   + **Company website** – Provide the full URL, including HTTP or HTTPS\.
   + **Support email** – The full email address where your company support can be contacted\.
   + **Support phone number** – The phone number, using an E\.164 format, where your company support can be contacted\. For example, *12065550101*\. You don't need to include the initial plus sign \(\+\)\.

1. When you're finished, choose **Create**\. This submits your company registration to The Campaign Registry\. Typically, approval is instantaneous\.

1. After your company is registered, you can create a 10DLC campaign\. For information about creating a 10DLC campaign, see [Registering a 10DLC campaign](settings-register-campaign-10dlc.md)\.
